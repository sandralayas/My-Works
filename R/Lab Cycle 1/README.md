R programming language 

Program 1 Overview
This program is a simple text analysis and manipulation tool. It processes a paragraph of text to provide key insights and also allows you to modify the content by replacing specific words.
Features
 * Word Count: Calculates the total number of words in the provided text.
 * Average Word Length: Determines the average length of all words, giving you a quick measure of the text's complexity.
 * Longest Word: Identifies and prints the single longest word found in the paragraph.
 * Word Replacement: Replaces all occurrences of a specified word with a new one you choose. This feature is case-insensitive, ensuring comprehensive replacement.
How to Use
 * Enter Text: The program will first ask you to input a paragraph.
 * Analyze: It will immediately perform the analysis and display the word count, average word length, and the longest word.
 * Replace: You'll then be prompted to enter a word to find and a new word to replace it with.
 * View Output: The program will print the modified paragraph, showing the result of your replacement.


Program 1 Overview
Caesar Cipher
This script is a simple tool that encrypts text using a Caesar cipher. It's a classic method where you shift each letter of a message a certain number of places down the alphabet.
How It Works
 * Encrypts text: Give it a sentence and a number (the "key"), and it'll shift every letter.
 * Works both ways: You can use the same key to decrypt the message and get your original text back.
 * Keeps it simple: It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters and leaves all other characters (like spaces and punctuation) alone.
How to Use
 * Run the script.
 * Enter the sentence you want to encrypt.
 * Enter a number for the shift key.
That's it! It will show you the encrypted message and then decrypt it to prove it works.
Example:
If you encrypt "Hello World" with a key of 3, you get "Khoor Zruog".
