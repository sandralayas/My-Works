    <p class = "paragraph"> It is a document writing
     and editing web application. It means you can create 
     documents, edit, doc files, write letters, create reports, 
     newsletters, banners, brochures, and almost anything that 
     you need for official work. It is a word-processing software 
     application and the functionality is similar to Microsoft Word. 
     Some text editors are small and simple, while others offer 
     broad and complex functions. For example, Unix and Unix-like 
     operating systems have the pico editor (or a variant), but many 
     also include the vi and Emacs editors. Microsoft Windows systems 
     come with the simple Notepad, though many people—especially 
     programmers—prefer other editors with more features. Under Apple Macintosh's classic Mac OS there was the native TeachText later replaced by SimpleText in 1994, which was replaced in Mac OS X by TextEdit, which combines features of a text editor with those typical of a word processor such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These features are not available simultaneously, but must be switched by user command, or through the program automatically determining the file type.
