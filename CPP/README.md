### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Compile and Run

Give detailed instructions on how to build and run the project. This section should be specific to your project's build system (e.g., CMake, Make, or a simple compiler command).

#### Prerequisites

  * A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
  * [Any specific dependencies, like CMake or other libraries]

#### Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sandralayas/My-Works.git
    cd My-Works/CPP
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [Project-Name]
    ```
3.  **Compile the code:**
      * **Using a simple compiler command:**
        ```bash
        g++ main.cpp -o my_program
        ```
      * **Using CMake:**
        ```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        ```
4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```
    *Or if using CMake, the executable will be in the `build` directory.*
    ```bash
